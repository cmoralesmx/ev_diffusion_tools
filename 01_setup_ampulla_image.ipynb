And depending on their biogenesis, this range becomes narrower. In the case of oviductosomes, experimental data has shown they typically have diametral size between 30 and 300 nm. However, more specific characterisation has narrowed down this range even further to be between 80 and 150 nm. Therefore, for the first version of our model, we decided to work with sizes in this range only (80 to 150 nm or 0.080 to 0.150 um) using increments of 10 nm (0.010um).\n",
